# FinFet-Characterization
FinFet Characterization and Domino Logic Operation using HSPICE

FinFets structures are 3D CMOS structures developed to tackle the challenges of scaling of planar bulk MOSFETs. FinFets are double gate devices. The gate of the Finfet surrounds the active region of the device forming a 3D structure. The FinFet can be implemented in three modes: short gate, independent gate and low power mode. This project deals with the study of the DC transfer characteristics (Ids vs Vgfs) of the P type and N type FinFets. The project also discusses the implementation of the FinFet inverter in SG mode and LP mode. The third task of the project implements the 4-input domino AND gate and 4-input domino OR gate in SG mode and IG mode. A comparison is drawn between the different modes of operation based on leakage power and delay.
